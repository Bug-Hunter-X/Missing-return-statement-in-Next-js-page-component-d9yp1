# Missing Return Statement in Next.js Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  This can lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement within the `About` component's function.  Next.js expects page components to return JSX, and the absence of a return statement results in an undefined return value, causing an error.

## Solution

The solution is simply to add a `return` statement to the `About` component in `pages/aboutSolution.js`, explicitly returning the JSX to be rendered.
